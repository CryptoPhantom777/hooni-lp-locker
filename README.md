## Getting Started

Clone the repository and then run inside the project folder:

```sh
$ bun install # install Solhint, Prettier, and other Node.js deps
```

If this is your first time with Foundry, check out the
[installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.


## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing `Test` from `forge-std`, and then you inherit it in your test
contract. Forge Std comes with a pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/) environment
accessible via the `vm` property. If you would like to view the logs in the terminal output, you can add the `-vvv` flag
and use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog).
